OS-1222,Contract,"The Committee On Climate Change",Open,2022-12-09T13:21:55Z,"Delivering Net Zero and climate resilience through the local planning system: barriers and opportunities","The Climate Change Committee  
The Climate Change Committee (CCC) was set up as part of the Climate Change Act. The CCC is an independent body that advises both on reducing emissions in the UK and adapting to the climate changes in the UK.    

The CCC's full range of past reports are available here:  Publications - Climate Change Committee (theccc.org.uk)
2	Background

Local authorities - delivering Net Zero and climate resilience

The planning system is the key lever that local authorities hold to shape developments in their regions. This can impact the design of communities, in particular the extent to which their buildings, transport systems, and land align to the pathways required to meet Net Zero and adapt to the changing climate. 

The present National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) does include objectives which emphasise that local plans should consider sustainability and climate impacts. However, these are ill-defined in comparison to other objectives (e.g. housing) and there is currently significant variation between local authorities in how they are being implemented.

The CPRE (Campaign to Protect Rural England) recently undertook a piece of research that explored 24 local plans outside Greater London, concluding that climate is not generally being considered as a central priority in the vast majority, and that changes to the NPPF are needed to make clear what local authorities are expected to do to ensure that their plans are compliant with the wider Net Zero strategy. Our project should seek to build upon this work by trying to understand what specific barriers hinder better alignment between local plans and sustainability objectives, and how these should be overcome.

Several other recent studies explore how the planning system can play a key role in delivering Net Zero:

•	Green Alliance's 2020 paper on the local climate challenge highlighted a misalignment of priorities in the planning system, as well as practical difficulties around the appraisal tools used and the powers available to local authorities.
•	The use of these tools was explored in more detail in UK100's 2021 report on local authority powers.
•	The Centre for Cities set out a vision for improved spatial planning to enable lower carbon community development in its 2021 work

Other recent reports have produced adaptation guidance based on the NPPF and National Adaptation Programme (NAP) for local authorities. However, there is currently no mandatory requirement for local authorities to report on adaptation, and a lack of research combining the practical and structural barriers for delivering this guidance and recommendations for aligning adaptation/mitigation:
•	ADEPT, Defra and Local Adaptation Advisory Panel Guide
•	Town and Coastal Planning Association Adaptation guide
•	Local Partnerships Climate Adaptation Toolkit, which summarises the risks highlighted by the 3rd Climate Change Risk Assessment for local authorities.

The Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance (LEAF) Coalition is a voluntary global coalition bringing together the private sector and governments to provide finance for tropical and subtropical forest conservation through carbon markets. The UK Government played a key role launching the LEAF Coalition in April 2021, alongside the US and Norwegian governments. At the World Leaders Summit at COP 26 the LEAF Coalition announced it met its initial goal of mobilising $1 billion USD for countries and states committed to increasing ambition to protect tropical and sub-tropical forests and reduce deforestation. At COP27 it announced that a further $500m has been mobilised, with 100% coming from private companies. Funding will be delivered to jurisdictions that successfully reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation. This will be done through payments for verified emission reductions - payments which are made only after reductions in deforestation have been independently confirmed.

Due to the complexity and number of different requirements needed to transact carbon credits under the LEAF programme, the UK hopes to design a bespoke technical assistance (TA) programme to support countries that are close to signing emissions reductions payment agreements (ERPAs). And those where strategic projects and technical support could unblock national approval for subnational participation in LEAF. The LEAF TA programme would be demand led by forest country governments (with direct input from BEIS and Embassy colleagues) to find out what their specific needs and support requirements are. This would enable them to engage/sign up to the LEAF coalition more quickly and comfortably. The overall aim of the programme is to help them sign their ERPAs, generate the credits and ultimately received results-based payments.

The UK is looking to procure a TA delivery partner to lead on the design and implementation of this programme of support, working closely with BEIS and UK embassies overseas. This would include sourcing technical consultants that could carry out the work in country. 

Indicative timelines for this programme would be to have a delivery partner in place by April 2023 with an indicative set of programme activities devised by June. Implementation would begin in July/August.

BEIS has established a new unit, the Government Office for Technology Transfer (GOTT), to support public sector organisations to unlock the potential of that innovation through the development and exploitation of knowledge assets (KAs). 

Within the public sector, KA's include intangible assets such as intellectual property, datasets, new ideas, processes, or methods, together with organisational knowhow and expertise. Exploitation routes include commercialisation or wider adoption within UK government or the wider public sector. The outcomes are similar - delivering benefit for the UK economy and society.

GOTT is preparing to launch a new Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) containing multiple professional services categories from which we intend to draw down relevant sector-specific expertise in support of individual projects and developing wider capability focused on KAs.

We are seeking experts with experience in Technology Transfer and Commercialisation to provide hands-on support and guidance to public sector organisations, GOTT's 'clients'.  Many projects will involve the translation and commercialisation of KAs into opportunities which maximise economic, financial and/or societal benefits. Some projects may also focus on supporting GOTT's clients to develop their own internal capabilities to better manage and exploit their KAs in the future.

GOTT's clients will hold KAs which have been identified to have potential for wider market adoption and commercialisation and wish to understand routes to exploit these assets. Dependent upon the needs of each client project, providers might be commissioned to help assess the market potential for client-owned assets or help to evaluate the route to market where potential has already been identified, in order to advance the commercial case for development and exploitation. There may also be targeted support focused on intellectual property identification, due diligence, and protection. In some cases, GOTT may require access to legal expertise for client projects and issues that may be encountered along the commercialisation/exploitation process.",,,"Any region","73000000 79100000 79310000 79410000 80510000 ",,KAGuidance@beis.gov.uk,"Trinity Bridge House",,Salford,"M3 5EG",England,,https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-office-for-technology-transfer,,,"

MS-1222,Contract,"The Committee On Climate Change",Open,2022-12-05T11:36:33Z,"Historical trends in domestic energy efficiency retrofits and the potential for near-term market growth","1	Introduction and summary of requirements / Preamble
The Climate Change Committee (CCC) is an independent, statutory body established under the Climate Change Act 2008. Our purpose is to advise the UK and devolved governments on emissions targets and to report to Parliament on progress made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for and adapting to the impacts of climate change.
The aim of this project is to expand our understanding of the historical extent of energy efficiency retrofits, identify current market trends, and assess the capacity for existing supply chains to grow and deliver the volume of retrofits implied by our Sixth Carbon Budget Pathways.
2	Background
Across the UK, the number of energy efficiency measures installed in homes through government-backed schemes peaked in [2012]. Since then, installations have fallen significantly. The Government's target is for all UK homes to be at least EPC C by [2030].  However, at the current rate of progress this target will not be reached for decades. 
There is good data available which describes the number of households that have received energy efficiency improvements through government schemes, such as the Energy Company Obligation (ECO), the Green Deal Framework, the Green Homes Grant Local Authority Delivery Scheme (LAD) and the Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund (SHDF). However, we lack similar information about the extent of retrofits undertaken by owner occupiers, landlords and others without government backing.
Rising energy prices have improved the economic case for energy efficiency. Reducing energy waste from homes is also an essential step to reduce emissions from buildings and reach Net Zero. 
As we (the CCC) are preparing work for our 2023 Progress Report, and the Seventh Carbon Budget, we want to update our approach to assessing the state of domestic energy efficiency. This entails developing a more comprehensive understanding of the current state of energy efficiency in UK homes, and the path the market has taken over the past fifteen years. We want to understand the remaining potential to improve homes, and the capacity within the market to grow supply chains to meet this need.

Educational psychologists (EP) play a key role in supporting children and young people, particularly those with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). They work within the education system and wider community to help in identifying SEND and advise schools, families, and the wider workforce on how to support children and young people with SEND. They provide a link between schools and wider community services such as CAMHs, social care, the justice system, and others, to improve outcomes for children and young people. They also have a statutory role in contributing to Education, Health, and Care (EHC) assessments. 

The Department for Education is seeking to procure the training for the Level 8 Educational Psychologist postgraduate qualification, accredited by the Health Care Professions Council (HCPC), for an agreed number of trainees, using suitably qualified and experienced personnel. 

The total value of this contract is anticipated to be £32.2m, which would train three cohorts, each with over 200 trainee educational psychologists.  The DfE recently announced an investment of £21m for the first two cohorts, however, the final of these three cohorts will be subject to future Spending Review agreement. We are open to this work being split across multiple suppliers. This budget would be expected to fund the full three-year tuition fees for trainee educational psychologists, as well as a first-year bursary payment for trainees, and associated course administration costs. 
We anticipate a six-year contract, commencing in September 2023 and terminating in August 2029. There would be a period of approximately one year allotted between contract commencement in September 2023, and the start date of the first trainee cohort, in September 2024. This period is to facilitate the Contractor(s) to become HCPC accredited and to become compliant with any other technical or legal standard, and to run the recruitment process for the 2024 trainee cohort.
 
The current EP training programme has established a strong reputation in the market as a prestigious postgraduate training route for EPs.  This procurement offers an opportunity to maintain the high quality of the training and to develop the programme to meet the needs of employers of psychological services to children and young people, particularly Local Authorities. 

We are particularly interested in provision which actively encourages trainees from regions with current shortages of qualified educational psychologists, and welcome suggestions to approach this.",,,"North East,North West,Yorkshire and The Humber,East Midlands,West Midlands,East of England,London,South East,South West","80000000 ",,EDPSYCHS.NCTL@education.gov.uk,"Sanctuary Buildings, 20, Great Smith Street",,London,"SW1P 3BT",England,+4412345678,,,"https://education.app.jaggaer.com ",,01/01/1,01/01/1,30/12/2022,YES,tender_301403/1103315,No,No,No,,,,,,,,,," ",

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Jaggaer eSourcing Portal.

Brief Description of Requirement

The research is set in the context of the new Financing Net Zero programme (FNZ), which is soon to be launched by Innovate UK.  FNZ is a £15m programme with the ambition to accelerate finance in to 'Climate Tech' .  Interventions are being designed to address the huge gap between the current scale of climate tech investment and that needed for the UK to meet its decarbonisation and economic goals.

The requirement is to perform a series of rapid studies aligned with 'deep-dive' net zero sectors or technologies. 

These are:
1. Domestic building retrofit
2. Energy whole systems integration, in particular the use of digital technologies and platforms
3. Circular critical materials, specifically Rare Earth Elements
4. Hydrogen supply chains for distribution and storage.

Focusing on the investment ecosystem and investment challenges in each deep dive area, studies are expected to build on existing information and convene dissemination roundtables to produce the desired research outputs.

The impact of this research is expected to be an improvement in design of FNZ. In particular the activities related to addressing barriers for investors and understanding Innovate UK's role in accelerating net zero finance.

As a pre-study it is also expected to lay foundations for future research, which may deepen the analysis in one of the deep dive sectors, expand in to other sectors, and also look deeper at specific investment challenges that cut across different sectors.

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Supplier Attachments tab within the Jaggaer eSourcing Portal.

This ITT is issued as part of the procurement process.
The Caring in Partnership residential children's home block contract was first commissioned in 2018 and has been successful in securing and growing the number of children's homes operating within Plymouth and in being aspirational for the children placed. It has also contributed to successful partnership working between placement providers and the Council and its partners, and between providers themselves. The aim of the service is to provide local homes for local children, supported by a network of good quality provision and underpinned by partnership working across agencies. We want Plymouth children and young people to remain as close to the city as possible, and to be able to support those who are placed outside their home area to safely return.
	Children and young people in the care of Plymouth City Council require a range of placements to meet their needs. Among these are residential children's homes, used for the most complex children and young people who struggle to manage the relationships in a family home. The Council wants to place in children's homes based on a model of care which is as close to a family environment as possible; with a consistent staff team skilled in working with children and young people with attachment difficulties and other challenges from adverse childhood experiences.
	
	The work specified within this tender has been split into Lots:
•	Lot 1 - Existing provision in and near to Plymouth
•	Lot 2 - Homes to be added to the contract at a later date

We are seeking to contract with a range of providers, both those who already have provision in or within 10 miles of the Plymouth city boundary, and those who wish to develop such provision. The spend for 2021/2022 on block contracted placements within the city boundary was approximately £4million. 
The Council is seeking to contract a maximum of 20 beds for Lot 1.
The contract will be managed through a range of meetings between the Council and providers and partners to encourage partnership working; these will include individual contract management meetings as well as group provider forums to share good practice and collectively resolve issues.
The following local authorities are parties to the contract and will be offered the option to express an interest in any vacant beds the Council is unable to fill:
•	Torbay Council
•	Devon County Council
•	Somerset County Council

The anticipated duration of the contract is for 3 years plus options to extend on a 1 year +1 year basis.

BURY001-DN648226-51198972,Contract,"Bury Council",Open,2022-12-15T19:32:54Z,"Provision of Public Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure","Bury Council is offering a list of locations to form the basis of a concessions contract for a supplier who is willing to install, operate, and maintain Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (EVCI) at these locations.   

The successful bidder will be able to assess feasibility, install, operate, and maintain a network of EVCI in Bury without any financial support from the Council or external funding the Council has applied for.  

The type/speed of EVCI may vary on the type of asset or location of the asset put forward by the Council. The Council anticipates that for locations that serve a large population the infrastructure will be Rapid (50kW) or Ultra Rapid (>100Kw) and in more remote areas where the EVCI is only likely to serve local residents, Fast (7kW-22kW) infrastructure is more suitable.   

In locations that are suitable for grant funding from the government, the Council is willing to work with the supplier to complete the necessary application. Any match funding that is required will be provided by the supplier.    

The Council would like the option to add extra locations if identified and offer them to the Supplier under the same arrangement over a specified period.   

The Council has the aim of being Carbon Neutral by 2038 and therefore would not want to increase its carbon consumption by installing EVCI.

It is used by Advisers when first approached about a parkland. It helps the Adviser understand the significance and risks associated with a parkland, ultimately assigning a priority to the site being assessed. The results of the Prioritisation Assessment are to give the parkland a priority score of High / Medium / Low. The resulting priority enables the Adviser and Area Team to assess the availability of resource (time and budget) that would be required in taking forward a parkland. The Excel spreadsheet sits in a central location and is a record of all parklands that have been scored.  

A total of 602 parklands are in agri-environment agreements that are coming to an end in 2023-25. This is based on the number of agreements with a common parkland option requiring a management plan. It is possible that a number of the identified agreements are small single fields of wood pasture. This is anticipated to be in the minority.

The overall aim of the research is to understand the operating environment for transnational education  (TNE) at the higher education level in Egypt. 

The British Council is interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the TNE operating environment in Egypt at the higher education level, including relevant policies, student demand, current and potential scale, financial feasibility, competition, and likely future developments in this area. The outputs of this research will be used to provide reliable and up-to-date information to the UK education sector as well as helping the British Council to better design policies to support UK universities' activities in this area. The research will also assist policy makers in Egypt to assess the impact of the TNE regulations introduced in 2018, whether they are achieving the intended outcomes and whether additional changes are needed to maximise partnership opportunities between the UK and Egypt.

20221215140914-72814,Contract,"United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority",Open,2022-12-15T14:09:19Z,"H3AT TMC Metal Bellow Pump","The objective of Tritium Monitoring and Counting (TMC) project is to design, build and operate a test rig that will allow different on-line gas composition analysers to be tested under some of operating conditions that would be found in the DEMO plant. The intention of this work is to develop a tritium analytics experiment to support the DEMO tritium accountancy concept, namely, to provide improved knowledge on critical measurement techniques so that the associated uncertainty of the DEMO accountancy statement is reduced. Achieving this is prerequisite to satisfying the regulatory requirements pertaining to safety, the environment and non-proliferation for which the need to know how much tritium there is and where the tritium is in the fuel cycle at all times is key. A further requirement is the ability to measure tritium to satisfy the needs for process monitoring and control (PMC).

To this end, four operating conditions have been identified: static, continuous, recirculation and response rate. The first phase of this project (Romanelli, 2021) showed that Raman and Mass Spectrometry are highly advanced in technical readiness for tritium measurements in DEMO. Therefore, Raman Spectrometry will be tested as a continuous measurement technique with Mass Spectrometry used as a reference technique.

The TMC experimental rig is intended for gas analysis using a reference analyser and analytical analysers. The mass spectrometer has been chosen as the reference analyser while the Raman spectrometer is the analytical analyser. There is also the potential for using a second analytical analyser. Gas samples will be analysed using these analysers in different operational modes. The analysed gases will then be evacuated to a suitable location.

Among the several required components for the TMC rig, there are different types of pumps.  Object of the present tender is a metal bellow pump.",,,"South East","31681200 42122000 42122450 ","Ben Oborne",ben.oborne@ukaea.uk,"Culham Science Centre",,Abingdon,"OX14 3DB",ENG,"+44 1235467082",www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-atomic-energy-authority,,"https://uk.eu-supply.com/app/rfq/rwlentrance_s.asp?PID=58176&B=UKAEA https://uk.eu-supply.com/ctm/Company/CompanyInformation/Index/72814 ",,27/01/2023,31/03/2023,13/01/2023,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Products,30000,40000,,,,,,,"Open ",,12:00

Land-based projects (including machinery development) must take place on lowland peat soils in England. Product development projects must be based in England, but the paludicultural crops used to develop the product can be sourced from further afield if sufficient supplies cannot be sourced in England.
The intention of PEF is to help develop the evidence base and create the conditions for paludiculture enterprises in England, to facilitate this, outputs generated by PEF Grants will be made available to others.

Leeds
Leeds already offers a virtual ward hospital @home model for frailty and respiratory and has plans to expand the bed base and introduce mental health input to enhance the frailty pathway. These services deliver both step-up and step-down pathways but are not currently enabled with the use of remote monitoring technology. 
Leeds plan to expand their virtual ward pathways, and further increase capacity through the implementation of a new remote monitoring virtual ward hub that will primarily provide step-down pathways to support patients across the following specialities:
•	Frailty
•	Respiratory
•	Surgery
•	Cardiac heart failure  


Calderdale, Kirklees and Wakefield (CKW)
CKW Virtual Ward pathways include:
•	Frailty
•	Respiratory

Across the Calderdale, Kirklees and Wakefield (CKW) footprints, there is an existing virtual ward for frailty, providing safe and optimal care to frail older adults who are presenting with urgent or emergent care needs. This service is for adult patients aged over 75, and there are plans to expand the bed base, in addition to offering this service to patients from the age of 65. CKW also plans to open respiratory beds for patients aged 16+ with chronic respiratory disease/exasperation and COPD.

There is potential for additional care pathways to be included in the future such as cardiology, end of life care and diabetes management.


Bradford District and Craven
Within the programmes, there could be scope to extend the supplier contract to include Bradford District and Craven virtual ward providers within the contract period.  Bradford District and Craven who already have virtual wards operating for frailty and multi-specialty pathways will be expanding their bed base and increasing their capacity within their multi-specialty pathways covering end of life and palliative care, general surgery, cardiology, diabetes, nephrology and orthopaedics.",,"LS9 7TF","United Kingdom","48517000 44316400 ","Martin Ball",martinball@nhs.net,"Beckett Street",,Leeds,"LS9 7TF",GB,,,,,,01/04/2023,31/03/2025,31/01/2023,NO,,No,No,No,Products,300000,,,,,,,,"OpenOJEU ",,12:00
IT-1222,Contract,"The Committee On Climate Change",Open,2022-12-07T16:21:25Z,"Archetypes for transforming rural UK land-use to high-carbon, climate resilient, nature rich and economically productive systems","The CCC's advice on the level of Sixth Carbon Budget in the 2030s was accepted by Government in 2021 . Meeting the Sixth Carbon Budget and the longer-term Net Zero target by 2050 requires contribution from all sectors of the economy, including the agriculture and land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sectors. This will require a transformation in how land is used in the UK, with land released out of agricultural production for alternative uses such as afforestation, peatland restoration and bioenergy crops. Under the Balanced Pathway, we estimated that 9% of agricultural land would be needed to deliver these measures, rising to a fifth by 2050. 

In addition to climate change mitigation, transforming land use can deliver other multiple objectives, including adapting to climate change, biodiversity, and other environmental goals. The CCC's third Independent Assessment of UK Climate Risk (CCRA3)  identified eight priority risk areas that the Committee identified as being critical for adaptation in the next two years, four of which relate to the natural environment and the use of land. Effective action to change land use before projected climate change impacts occur must be investigated to enable land managers to protect and enhance the land's ability to maintain the delivery of essential ecosystem services.

Our analysis to date has focused on estimating the impact of land use change and management on carbon and GHG emissions at the national level (i.e. England and each of the devolved administrations (DAs)). In practice, the changes that are needed to mitigate and prepare for climate change will vary across different locations according to a range of climatic, economic, social and environmental factors, at the farm, catchment and landscape level. 

The aim of this project therefore is to identify and quantify the impact of a set of plausible land use transitions for a number of representative rural land use 'archetypes' in England and the UK's DAs out to 2035 and 2050. The transitions should focus on changes in land use and management that deliver increased carbon sequestration and GHG emissions reductions, and which can also contribute to climate resilience, maintenance of food production, increased biodiversity and deliver co-benefits such as access to nature. In some cases, there may be trade-offs, and these should also be identified.

In future, the CCC expect to develop full spatial scenarios for UK land-use change that deliver across the multiple objectives. This project does not aim to develop these spatial scenarios, but it will be used to inform any such future work.

The Commissioner has made a strategic decision not to reprocure practices with a weighted list size below approximately 10,000 patients as stand-alone APMS contracts, and to look at alternative contracting models. This is intended to ensure robust, resilient, and high-quality services for the population in the longer term, as we have found that smaller practices operated under APMS contracts in this area have frequently struggled with resilience and recruitment issues.

Neath Hill Health Centre has an actual patient list size of 3,983 (weighted 3,586.31) as of September 2022. The ICB has a strong desire that the current premises located at 1 Tower Crescent, Neath Hill, Milton Keynes, MK14 6JY, are maintained within primary care ensuring adequate access, capacity, and resilience for general practice services. The ICB has therefore decided the most appropriate way to achieve this aim is to offer this practice as a branch surgery with patient list to GMS providers, thus retaining the current premises with managed list dispersal to the successful bidder. Practices outside the Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes area will need to ensure they have their home ICB's support for this opportunity.  

As a branch of the successful bidder's existing GMS contract, the annual contract value represented by the branch surgery will reflect global sum rates.

This is purely an early engagement exercise and does not commit the Commissioners to carry out a procurement process. Any subsequent procurement will be advertised separately and all organisations wanting to participate will need to respond to the procurement advertisement as and when published.

Current services will remain in place during this period in line with existing contracts and service level agreements.

The procurement will be advertised in accordance with the requirements of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (as amended) (the ""Regulations"") to the extent that the Regulations relate to services within the scope of Schedule 3 thereto (Social and Other Specific Services). The Commissioner and AGCSU are, therefore, bound only by those parts of the Regulations applying to Schedule 3 services.",,,"South East","85121100 ","Bilal Arif",bilal.arif@nhs.net,"Cardinal Square",,Derby,"DE1 3QT",GB,,,"Contracts Finder Notice for C118489 EOI for the provision of primary medical services at Neath Hill, Milton Keynes.docx ",,,,,05/01/2023,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,Services,,,,,,,,," ",

In this the Council committed to ""build or invest in large scale renewable generation project(s), e.g. solar farms"".

Winchester City Council is now undertaking a procurement exercise to appoint a consultant or strategic partner with appropriate experience to ensure the positive delivery of utility scale renewable energy generation scheme(s) across the district, including advice on engagement, site identification and business plan development.  The consultant is required to advise and guide the council in the identification and  development of renewable energy project(s), providing technical, legal, financial and engineering advice and additionally advising how the project will assist the council in attaining its Carbon Neutrality Targets.

The Council wishes to put engagement with the local community at the forefront of the project and so the design and delivery of an engagement and communications programme will be an essential first component of the support required. 

Organisations are asked to tender for Phases 1 to 4 of a sequential package of work which is outlined below. It should be noted that there is a possibility that additional work may arise that is not included within the scopes of Phases 1 to 4. As a consequence, the daily rates submitted will be used to agree the fees for carrying out additional instructions (either on a fixed fee or time related basis, as appropriate). It is expected that organisations will demonstrate competency in taking renewable energy projects from inception to completion including evidencing a track record of successful development of renewable energy sites for the public sector. 

The four phases included within the RFQ comprise:
Phase 1 - Community awareness raising and engagement
Phase 2 - Site Identification & Feasibility
Phase 3 - Design, Development of Business Plan and Engagement around preferred site(s)
Phase 4 -Planning pre-application and Engagement on preferred site(s)

It is recognised that those bidding many not have expertise in all areas and so a consortium approach is acceptable. Evidence of the approach and of the organisations' capability to deliver each work package is required. It is expected that work packages for Phases 1 to 4 will be delivered within 6 months and a timetable setting out delivery timescales should be included.

      The council is seeking to work with a primary provider who will manage funds on behalf of the council for the allocation of funding and delivery of energy efficiency works related to funding streams made available by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS). Such funding streams are likely to include for, but not be limited to, the following schemes:
      
      • Local Authority Delivery (LAD)
      • Home Upgrade Grant (HUG)
      • Social Housing Decarbonisation Funding (SHDF)
      • Warm Homes Funding (WHF)
      
      The council leads a group of 21 partner local authorities under the banner of the Warmer Homes Consortium (WHC). WHC membership is open to any Local Authority or Registered Provider located within the South West, South East, London and East of England. Whilst the framework will be used for delivery of efficiency measures across the geographical areas covered by the participating WHC members, the work will be managed through the council who will be the sole party to the agreement and resulting call off contracts.
      
      The council is targeting award of the framework agreement by 3rd March 2023.
      
      Once in place the agreement will run for a duration of 4 years. Estimates for spend across the term of the agreement are:
      
      • Direct consideration to framework providers(s): £5M - £20M
      • Associated total expenditure of grant monies for energy efficiency works: £50M - £200M
      
      Expenditure via the framework will be dependent upon the securing of future funding and uptake by WHC members. No guarantees can be made in respect of the value estimates stated which may be significantly exceeded should significant additional related funding streams and / or further WHC participation be secured over the term of the agreement.
      
      Whilst the council is seeking to work with a single primary provider, 3-4 overall providers will be appointed onto the framework agreement.
      
      The top ranked provider will act as the primary delivery partner provider with call off contracts generally let via direct award with the remaining providers held in contingency in case of any significant performance issues.
      
      In addition the council may also opt to invite all providers to submit mini-competition proposals for project commissions which may require the development of alternative delivery models, access to specialist resources, etc.
      
      The council will run the procurement process to establish the framework agreement in accordance with the Open Procedure as defined within the Public Contracts Regulations (2015) in accordance with the following target programme:

We are exploring a potential new national urban greening accreditation, to create Nature Towns and Nature Cities across England.    

In summary this work will involve;
1.	Identifying the drivers for private sector investors in urban greening (either new or retrofit green infrastructure, urban nature or biophilic buildings), and the levers that would encourage greater investment in urban greening.  We would particularly like to explore the potential role of an area-wide urban greening or urban nature accreditation such as a Green or Nature City/Town/Neighbourhood/Street in attracting investment for green interventions and nature-based solutions.  Market segmentation is likely to be required to understand a range of private sector drivers.  We are interested in understanding the potential scale of any future investment and particular outcomes or products investors would like to 'buy into'.
   
2.	Scoping out one to one interviews with private investors and a private investors roundtable with Natural England and its partners to explore these drivers in more detail.  Use this research to advise on the development of accreditation outcomes, potential criteria and evaluation questions.",,,"United Kingdom","73000000 ","Susan Lenaghan",susan.lenaghan@naturalengland.org.uk,"Suite D Unex House","Bourges Boulevard",Peterborough,"PE1 1NG",England,"07584 883579",,"RFQ Private Investor Urban Accreditation Research FinalV2.docx ",,"This work for Natural England is focusing on urban areas driven by the importance of nature on people's doorsteps for people, nature, climate and prosperity.
NE is seeking to galvanise opportunities for investment around urban greening and are developing our thinking for an accreditation that would act as a 'wrapper' for activity in this area.  
To explore this further we want to;
•	Work with 6 - 10 local partnerships and learn from National Trust's Future Parks Accelerator
•	Make this work self-sustaining - the accreditation needs to be self-financed which is why we're exploring private investment as part of the package
•	Understand how an accreditation could deliver systemic change and bring in investment

NE engagement to date
NE has engaged with Local Authorities to grow our understanding of what LA's need from an accreditation.  We have also engaged across Government departments and with NGO's to grow our understanding.  We would now like to engage the private sector.  We have listened to a group of private companies through our colleagues in the Nature Recovery Network but would like to focus our learning now in the urban context.

DO NOT apply directly to the buyer.

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Jaggaer eSourcing Portal

This contract is for the delivery of estimates of regional jobs in the power sector and will involve researching employers to understand the locational distribution of jobs for each low carbon technology, split by nature of the job (e.g. manufacturing, construction,
Show less description
transportation, operation, etc), and the timing and duration of the jobs (i.e. short-term construction jobs, long-term maintenance jobs).
When complete, this work will give senior management and ministers figures on the jobs delivered by specific projects or policy aims and their expected regional distribution.

This work will allow BEIS to more closely align the Net Zero Strategy and Energy Security Strategy ambitions with the Levelling Up agenda. Due to the latter, there has been an increasing desire for BEIS to provide estimates of jobs supported at a regional level.

The aim of this work is to generate regionalised estimates of the jobs associated with the building and running of power sector projects (e.g. new offshore wind farms, nuclear plants, etc) to 2050. This will run parallel with current ONS work that takes a snapshot of total power sector jobs

Link to ONS Low carbon and renewable energy economy estimates
The snapshot of jobs produced is split by technology (eg. offshore wind, onshore wind, solar, etc.) and job type (Manufacturing, Construction, Professional, scientific and technical activities, etc.).
BEIS has internal projections on power sector capacity to 2050 in meeting the Net Zero targets, with estimated number of jobs at a national level based on GVA and require estimates of the number of jobs by region.

The objective of this project is to be able to estimate the number of regional jobs by year (including planning and construction) for any given project (eg. technology and capacity) by job type. These estimates should be consistent with ONS published snapshot figures.

Sport England's strategy Uniting the Movement was launched in 2021. At the heart of the strategy is a commitment to tackle inequalities and unlock the advantages of sport and physical activity for everyone. We are revolutionising our long-term partnership approach through how we invest in and support partners. These long-term partners, or System Partners, play a significant role in the sport and physical activity system, and ultimately have a critical role in implementing Uniting the Movement. Through the System Partner work we want to make the most of our collective resources and capabilities to tackle inequalities. 

We need to develop ways to track change, understand impact and learn together so that we can continually improve. We have been collaborating with System Partners to develop our thinking about what needs to be included in the Collective Evaluation and Learning for System Partners. Our hypothesis is that by improving our effectiveness as individual organisations (Better Organisations) and improving the connections and collaboration between us as a group of partners (Better Connected Systems) we will maximise our overall contribution to the shared ambitions of Uniting the Movement (Better Community Impact). 

The evaluation, and subsequent learning, will act as a catalyst to enhance how we work to develop our collaborative approach and understand the success of this work. We are therefore, looking to appoint an Evaluation and Learning Partner to help manage and support the collective evaluation and learning. The Evaluation and Learning Partner will play a critical role in ensuring the evaluation meets the needs of partners and Sport England.

UBIC001-DN647762-05302758,Contract,"UK Battery Industrialisation Centre",Open,2022-12-14T14:55:04Z,"Calender Equipment for UKBIC Flexible Industrialisation Line (FIL)","The UKBIC Flexible Industrialisation Line is designed to allow staged scale-up of electrode manufacture from laboratory scale through to GWh scale on UKBIC's existing high-volume electrode lines. The project will be phased and in the first phase equipment will be purchased to allow scale-up of electrode processes from the Flexible Industrialisation Line to UKBIC's high-volume electrode lines. This will incorporate mixing process compatible with UKBIC's mainline process and coating and drying equipment which will take batches of slurry and convert them onto anode and cathode foils.

Subsequent equipment will incorporate next generation electrode manufacturing processes, so solutions covering both scenarios are encouraged. This new electrode capability will be supplemented by flexible equipment to Calender and slit the electrode reels allowing them to be converted into cells using the main UKBIC cylindrical and pouch cell assembly lines, or other flexible cell manufacturing equipment that may be installed during a later phase. Calendering Equipment is specifically required to allow UKBIC to process Anode and Cathode electrodes from its own in-house Coating processes or from third party material produced external to UKBIC.

UKBIC currently has Calendering equipment in its Volume Industrialisation Line allowing for segregated Calendering of Anode and Cathode material however the size of the equipment is desired for Electrode Material at high levels of maturity and/or on a mass production scale. As a result, UKBIC is looking to install smaller equipment for customers at lower maturity level and allow for added flexibility and modularity as such that new/missing technologies from UKBICs Volume Industrialisation line can be used and proven.

The Calendering equipment will be installed in a new internal Clean Room facility to UKBIC and should allow for futureproofing with the known assumption of battery industry evolution and changes.",,,"United Kingdom","31000000 42000000 ","Procurement Tenders",ProcurementTenders@ukbic.co.uk,"Rowley Road",Baginton,Coventry,"CV8 3AL","United Kingdom","+44 2475267743",https://www.ukbic.co.uk/,,"https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=2b35719f-bb7b-ed11-811c-005056b64545 ",,11/03/2023,05/08/2024,01/02/2023,NO,,Yes,No,No,Products,1400000,,,,,,,,"Open ",,12:00

SA-1122,Contract,"The Committee On Climate Change",Open,2022-11-29T13:53:29Z,"Climate policy that cuts costs: An international policy analysis","The Climate Change Committee (CCC) is looking to widen its understanding of policy responses that both address recent economic pressures on households and businesses and deliver potential for accelerated emissions reduction. In addressing the increases in household and business costs that have resulted from energy prices pushing up the rate of inflation, Government should seek to identify options that also contribute to the UK's decarbonisation goals. Many countries are introducing policies with these dual aims in response to similar challenges and learning lessons from their efforts can inform a well-targeted policy response in the UK. The CCC is looking to analyse the international policy landscape in several key sectors, including buildings and transport.

To inform this work, the CCC is tendering a project 1) to establish an up-to-date summary of the key policies, including where relevant those targeted primarily at shifting behaviours,  2) where possible, evaluating (both quantitively and qualitatively as appropriate) these policies against a set of pre-determined criteria and analysing their potential effectiveness in a UK context and 3) identifying where and why potential cost-saving climate policies exist but have not been pursued in the UK and suggesting policies that would fill these identified gaps. 

Given the fast-paced nature of the crisis, the tendered work needs to be delivered by 19/04/2023, at a cost of £40,000 - £50,000 excluding VAT.

Background:
The LGF (£12bn) was the government flagship local economic development policy between 2015/16 and 2020/21, GBF provided LEPs with £900m to support 'shovel ready schemes' to stimulate areas most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic between 2020/21 and 2021/22. More information on allocations, projects and budgets can be found here: Getting Building Fund - https://www.gov.uk/guidance/getting-building-fund ; Local Growth Deals - https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/local-growth-deals.

Scope & Requirements:
The study will be divided in two phases: feasibility study (phase 1) and evaluation (phase 2). Phase 1 will aim to understand if process, impact and/or value for money evaluations of LGF and/or GBF would be feasible and robust. The process, impact and value for money evaluations of the programmes (phase 2) should focus on what was delivered, what can be learned, what difference the funds have made and what changed were caused, and how cost-effective were the funds. The contractor will be required to investigate a series of issues around scope, data, approaches, methods, analysis and propose options and related project plans for phase 2. The evaluation will implement the project plan proposed in the feasibility study.

Timelines & Governance:
The feasibility study will run from March to July 2023. The contract will continue into phase 2 in August 2023, only if the feasibility study findings will show that evaluation work would be feasible and robust enough. The project will be overseen by DLUHC's analysts and relevant stakeholders.

The fund links with the CIoS Skills and Labour Market Strategy 2030 , published by the LEP and Employment and Skills Board (ESB) and responds specifically to the following Actions:  	Transform: A Productive Workforce Action 2: Learning provision meets the sector-specific requirement of employers through a more collaborative and employer-led approach which aligns learning and training with employer demand, providing learners with clear progression pathways to higher level creative and technical skills;  Action 3: Step change in access to digital infrastructure, digital usage and digital skills across the area, supporting sectors, businesses and people to make the transition to a digital world and Action 4: Develop the leadership and high-level skills needed to drive growth, innovation and productivity. 
	
Additionally, CIoS has a high proportion of small and micro businesses and the highest proportion of self-employed business owners of all the LEP areas. These businesses tend to be the ones that need the most help but are often the least able to engage as time away from the business has cost implications

On behalf of CIoS Skills Hub, Cornwall Council wishes to invite tenders for 4 individual projects that provide an innovative approach to employer-led skills development and enabling skills to be more accessible for SMEs in CIoS.

Information requested : To ensure future Defence capability is maintained the Authority is embarking on a modernisation agenda, informed by industry, to ensure that it is resourced and configured to support the future needs of the Armed Forces. The new FHF has been identified as a particularly important part of this modernisation agenda, replacing the original facilities and to enable Brize Norton to meet the high demand signal set by Defence Strategic Direction (DSD). The new FHF should be in full compliance with military and civilian regulations including CAA, NASP, IATA and HMRC (full list will be provided during the procurement stage), both information and physical security, within a secure and safe environment, through an integrated infrastructure and material handling equipment solution.
To enable this a series of Early Market Engagement Sessions will be held from 17th - 19th January 2023.
The aim of the Early Market Engagement is to gain an understanding of the market view around potential procurement options, and to further facilitate an informed approach to the development of a procurement strategy by assessing the advantages and disadvantages of various options. 
To facilitate this the Authority has created an RFI document with an overview of the requirement and the potential contractual approaches. The RFI also contains a range of questions that the Authority invites all interested parties to complete to further understand the feasibility of the proposed approach - for full information on the structure and requirements of this Early Market Engagement, please see the following:

The training is intended, and should be designed, to be delivered to volunteer buddies and will follow and include a 'train the trainer' model. The training should ensure, as a minimum, volunteer buddies are then aware of and able to apply/deliver:

•	Supporting Travel Planning
•	Travel Skills and Road Safety
•	Using Different Methods of Transport
•	Managing Personal Safety in the Community
•	Considerations for working in a Person-Centred way
•	Support Planning Skills
•	Safeguarding
•	Covid-19 considerations

Volunteer buddies will be sourced via a Staffordshire Volunteering Buddying Scheme being piloted by SCC and delivered by Support Staffordshire (who provide support to the Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise sector), in the districts of Staffordshire Moorlands, Lichfield and South Staffordshire. It is anticipated that training will initially be required for approximately 15 volunteers, with approximately 5 of those then requiring further 'train the trainer' training. These are currently just approximate numbers that will be finalised at a later date.

The scheme is aimed at providing temporary support to help local vulnerable adults to feel less lonely and socially isolated and increase their confidence and skills to access community activities, social care services and employment/volunteering opportunities. The vulnerable adults requiring support may have an assessed social care need (for example, an assessed eligible need for transport) and may include individuals with a learning disability, autism or other neurodiversity, or mental health need.

The maximum budget available, to include all training requirements, materials and associated costs is £15,000.

Expressions of interest should be returned, by email, to richard.deacon@staffordshire.gov.uk by 21 December 2022 and upon receipt, providers will be provided with a copy of a more detailed specification and a quotation template to complete and return by 11 January 2023",,,"West Midlands","80500000 ",,richard.deacon@staffordshire.gov.uk,"2 Staffordshire Place",,Stafford,"ST16 2DH","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,21/12/2022,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,,,,,,,,,," ",

The aim of this project is to foster new business partnerships between UK and Southeast Asian public and private sector organisations through a week-long series of engagements in two priority markets. It is also designed to create opportunities for networking and knowledge-sharing between public and private sector stakeholders across the UK and Southeast Asia, whilst also supporting the implementation of innovation-friendly policies that promote open and inclusive digital ecosystems and digital trade across the region.  
Building on the UK's formalised status as an ASEAN Dialogue Partner - the bloc's eleventh and first since 1996 - the UK and ASEAN committed to deepening collaboration on the digital economy through our newly-established ASEAN-UK Digital Innovation Partnership (DIP). Launched in September 2021, our digital partnership aims to unlock the vast potential held across our most innovative and cutting-edge public and private sector bodies - including by connecting and fostering new business partnerships. Our vision is to achieve these objectives through greater collaboration across three core pillars: (a) Digital Economy Business Partnerships; (b) Digital Policy, Regulation and Standards; and (c) Digital Transformation and Digital Inclusion. 
The UK and ASEAN have already delivered a range of initiatives and activities under each pillar - including delivering our first-ever ASEAN-UK Digital Business Showcase which brought together innovative tech companies to solve complex organisational challenges; creating new opportunities for dialogue on digital standards and policy between leading businesses and government bodies; and leading our largest-ever delegation of Southeast Asian tech companies to London Tech Week 2022. Our next objective is to deliver our first-ever UK-Southeast Asia Tech Week - one of our flagship projects under the DIP this year (2022 - 2023).

Children's Services teams that identify children and families that require commissioned service support will access the FPS when considering their options. 
Children and Family Support Service are available for a range of circumstances where needs are identified in the home, for example to support children with disabilities, when positive behaviour support services are required, therapeutic support and assessment is needed and also for support in the community to support children on the edge of the care system. On occasions commissioned support is required to support the placement of a cared for child. Every element of support to children and families is geared to maximise their positive outcomes, support mental health and wellbeing and the safety of children at home and in the community. 

Providers joining the FPS must adopt a person-centred approach and ensure that services are outcome focused, meeting the identified needs of individuals they support. Providers will adopt a strength-based approach, supporting people to recognise and achieve their full potential, whilst also working towards increased levels of health and wellbeing. 
The contract period will be for fixed term of 5 years. The FPS will open in rounds annually during the contract period, with two rounds in the first year, and then opening every twelve months. We may also open the FPS at any point during the contact period, should a need to do so arise. 

The FPS is divided into eight Lots, Providers can apply to join one or more lots / categories:

Lot 1	Life limiting or complex care and autism spectrum condition

They will appoint Ofgem as the regulator. All heat networks will be required to provide notification to Ofgem to be authorised, this means that all domestic consumers and micro-businesses will be protected by the regulatory regime, including consumer protections on pricing, transparency, and quality of service. Heat networks will also need to meet minimum technical standards and decarbonisation rules under the authorisation regime.
Ensuring consumers receive a fair price and undertaking price investigations where Ofgem is concerned prices are disproportionate will be particularly challenging, given the scale and diversity of the heat networks market. The current winter challenges due to the gas price increases also means this is an area where there will be an increased focus. It is important for Ofgem to have good understanding about the impact that inefficiencies in some heat networks can have on pricing.
Ofgem are seeking consultancy support to help better understand the relationship between technical efficiency and the costs of a heat network. This support will also include engagement with Government on the design of a technical assurance scheme to inform its design. This work will also inform Ofgem's understanding of how to compare or segment the market, and how these factors affect the price that heat networks customers are charged. Ofgem require modelling which can be added to and update with real data once this is available.

The Palais is both deeply rooted in community memory and central to Hepworth's artistic legacy worldwide, and holds significance for local residents as well as historians and enthusiasts of modern art. Located directly opposite Trewyn Studio - now the Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden - the Palais was gifted to Tate from the Hepworth Estate in 2015 and was awarded Grade II listed status in 2020. Together, these buildings housed the entire scope of Hepworth's creative work from 1949-1975. Tate are embarking on a capital project to renovate the Palais and uncover its rich history, realise its immense potential as a community-shaped heritage site, and continue its story by securing the building for the long term. Tate are looking to appoint a professional team to support this ambition and to realise an innovative design response to give the unique heritage of the Palais de Danse a new life.

The expected contract value is up to £9.5m. The contract is expected to run from April 2023 to the end of March 2025 with a possible extension(s) of up to 24 months in total and potential additional value of up to £9.5m. 

GMAP3 Afghanistan will contribute to the overall GMAP3 programme. The Global Mine Action Programme 3 (GMAP3) began in April 2022, and is building on the success of its predecessor (the Global Mine Action Programme 2) in tackling the threat of landmines and other explosive remnants of war. 

The strategic objective for GMAP3 in Afghanistan is to release land and conduct Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) that supports humanitarian emergency response and vulnerable communities. GMAP3 will protect the results of mine action in Afghanistan over the past two decades and provide sustainability by enhancing the national capacity of one or more local mine action IPs. 
The GMAP3 contract in Afghanistan will be designed and implemented to achieve all five outcomes of the GMAP3 Theory of Change (ToC):
-	Outcome 1:	Measurable progress towards Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention (APMBC), Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) and Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) treaty compliance and universalisation. 
-	Outcome 2:	Responsive and equitable nationally owned mine action through improved governance and with increased local implementation. This outcome will be delivered in Afghanistan solely through working with local implementing partners (details in the Terms of Reference).
-	Outcome 3:	Mine action integrated or sequenced with humanitarian / development / peacebuilding or stabilisation initiatives.
-	Outcome 4: Safe and productive land use improves livelihoods and basic services, improving the quality of life and the environment. 
-	Outcome 5:	Risk of harm reduced which increases returns and the freedom of movement. 

The GMAP3 contract in Afghanistan will be designed and implemented to achieve three of the four outputs of the GMAP3 ToC. Output 4, which refers to the Capacity Development (CD) of national authorities, is not applicable to GMAP3 in Afghanistan:
-	Output 1:	Land has been released for safe and productive use.
-	Output 2:	Increased awareness of the risk of harm from explosive ordnance.
-	Output 3: Increased collaboration with humanitarian, peace, stabilisation, development and environmental actors.
-	Output 5:	Enhanced capacity of local implementers, i.e. enhanced operational and management procedures, skills and systems of local IPs, leading to increased local implementation.

The HealthTech Innovation Gateway is a commercial solution underpinned by a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) and a procurement and commercial support 'service wrap' that aims to support suppliers (including innovators, start-ups and new entrants) navigate the NHS buying landscape and also streamline NHS buyers' adoption of emerging digital and health technology. 
Initially, the HealthTech Innovation Gateway will focus on technologies involving healthcare related Artificial Intelligence and Extended Reality (XR), also known as Immersive Technologies (immersive computer-generated environments): 
•	Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare is an opportunity to increase efficiency in decision making of Health and Care professional staff in varied ways. These sets of technologies support and automate problem solving carried out by medical professionals and allow them to make quicker and better decisions which humans alone would not be able to make. A broad range of techniques can be used to create artificially intelligent systems that carry out or augment health and care tasks, which have until now been completed by humans, or have not been possible previously; the possible techniques include but are not limited to inductive logic programming, machine learning, robotic process automation, natural language processing, computer vision, neural networks and distributed artificial intelligence.  
•	Extended Reality or Immersive Technologies (XR) is an umbrella term that encompasses virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR). 
XR enables a digital layer on top of the real world. This can range from small changes to the physical environment, such as visual overlays, to large changes, such as entire simulated worlds.  

Our Approved Organisation list of clients who access our frameworks can be found at: https://sbs.nhs.uk/proc-framework-agreements-support

We are committed to working with suppliers who are dedicated to Sustainability and Social Value and there will be a significant weighting on these elements in the tender.

As the industry and wider world places increasing importance on social and environmental impact, the Project Partners wish to undertake a full review of the EventIMPACTS project.
Partners are therefore looking to commission this review which will scope and clarify the aims and deliverables of EventIMPACTS to ensure its direction is aligned with the Project Partners' collective organisational objectives and has a clear purpose and strategy under which work can be delivered. 

The work will also include a review of the guidance and advice offered both on the EventIMPACTS website currently, the calculator tool and a scoping of other tools, advice, resources and guidance as to measurement of impact.

The Act further identifies that high-quality, personalised care and support can only be achieved where there is a vibrant, responsive market of service providers. Duties are placed on councils to commission a diverse and sustainable range of care and support providers who continuously improve quality and choice, in order to meet the needs of people who need care and support.
Day Opportunities play a key role in supporting disabled and older people to maintain and develop new skills, prevent social isolation, support inclusion and presence in their local communities and provide a break from caring and support for unpaid carers ensuring they can continue to offer ongoing support.
The focus of the Framework will be upon outcome-based support, with providers expected to both demonstrate innovative solutions to meet individual needs and clearly evidence how individual outcomes have been achieved.

We are therefore advising businesses of the opportunity to work alongside Swale Council and provide the necessary services. The current service is highly regarded and has received ongoing recognition from partners such as the RSPCA.   

In the last 12 months (Nov 2021 - Nov 2022) Swale Borough Council received a total of 260 reported stray dogs. 88 of these were taken to the kennels by our dog warden for owners to come forward, or to be re-homed if the dog was not collected. 44 of these were collected by owners and 39 were successfully re-homed by the kennels or passed on to suitable charities for re-homing (the remaining 5 had either passed away before we arrived, euthanised under a vets recommendation, or were delivered to another LA as the dog was found outside our borough).

Prior to advertising, we wanted to offer all interested parties the opportunity to suggest how the contract specification could be improved. We would be very interested to hear from any kennel establishments that may be able to assist in the provision of this service in its entirety, or for specific parts of it i.e. you may be able to kennel the dogs but not re-home them. We will then consider if the opportunity should be divided into lots involving collection, kennelling, and rehoming of the dogs.

These operational hours are currently under consideration and they may reduce after the review in time for the specification to be finalised. f you have requirements around collection times, we are flexible and still very interested to hear from you.

•	Dog owners can make appointments to collect their dogs from the current kennels and pay the fees incurred directly to the kennels (within normal working hours). Again, this is open for discussion as alternative models could apply.

•	After the statutory 7-day period the dog becomes the property of the council. We welcome ideas for how the re-homing of the dog could work but options may include the kennel taking ownership after day 7 and re-homing the dog directly. Alternatively, the council could arrange a place for the dog at a recognised re-homing charity (or possibly a hybrid of the two).  SBC do not perform any rehoming or home checks, so our dog warden currently starts the re-homing process by reaching out to established and respected rescue organisations. This is completed as quickly as possible however there are occasions where this takes more than the 7 days to be arranged. We operate a non-destruct policy unless it is in the best interest of the dog and under veterinary advice.

•	Animal welfare is of course critical, and establishments would need to have suitable facilities, protocols, record keeping, regulatory licences and procedures in place to ensure legislative compliance and high standards of welfare for the animals. 

If you are interested in this opportunity, or if you would be interested in providing an amended service, then please feel free to call us on the above telephone number to discuss. For example, you may be interested in leasing a set number of kennels for the council to use, rather than charging on a dog-by-dog basis.

The opportunity will be advertised for 30 days on the ProContract portal. Interested parties will need to register to apply.

If you are not interested in providing this contracted service, but you could offer a limited service (or a service in an emergency situation) and would like to be listed on our business continuity plan should we need additional kennel space due to unforeseen circumstances, then please let us know.

As part of this, the Council has set a target for its core estate to reach net zero by 2030. Electricity consumption is projected to decrease over the coming years through investment in energy efficiency and estate rationalisation, but the Council also has a commitment, through its renewable electricity strategy, to access 100% of its energy requirement from renewable sources and to maximise opportunities for both onsite and offsite renewable electricity generation.

As part of this commitment, the Council is keen to explore opportunities to develop solar generation on land assets that it owns. This could include both private wire and grid connected opportunities, with the potential for the Council to act as an off-taker for any projects that come forward. 

The Council has reviewed its landholdings and identified FOUR sites for development consideration. These sites have all undergone various land assessments to determine risk. The Council wants to determine the feasibility of developing ground mounted solar farms on these four sites and invites interested parties to respond to the Q&A pack prepared as part of this soft market testing. 

Responses will be reviewed, and shortlisted parties invited for a virtual Q&A session on the 30th or 31st January 2023. At this stage this opportunity is soft market test only and NOT A CALL FOR COMPETITION.

This market test exercise is to allow the Council to ascertain interest from the market, investigate potential options, and consider the best route for a potential future contract opportunity.

We exist to make sure that the most disadvantaged children in Birmingham live safe and happy lives and have the opportunity to reach their full potential. 
      
      Birmingham Youth Offending Service (BYOS) is committed to working with children, families, and victims through a trauma lens. It is critically important that we see offending as a symptom of a child's experiences and trauma and have the understanding that if we tackle the root causes of offending, we are likely to be better able to improve a child's life chances and safeguard them and others.
      
      BYOS is seeking to engage with one single Provider to deliver a speech and language therapeutic service to all children who are supported by Birmingham YOS. This Service will ensure children receive timely and robust assessment and interventions where required and, provide case managers with information, training and support to inform targeted intervention risk and vulnerability plans.
      
      The children BYOS work with will often display behaviours that are described as challenging  and that have been affected by social and cultural isolation, engagement in gang affiliated activities or being criminally exploited. They will often have experienced trauma and emotional difficulties and experienced a range of disadvantage that is impacting on their life chances. 
      
      Alongside Speech, language and communication needs, we know that there are further factors that children within BYOS have experienced disproportionately, for example having  mental and emotional health needs, special educational needs, substance misuse, diagnosed or undiagnosed conditions such as Autism, Asperger's, and ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Many children are also disproportionately care experienced.
      
      These children will require an offer of enhanced support to seek to redress this imbalance. The provider must work in a way that understands and responds to this adversity and trauma and work in accordance with the BYOS vision and guiding principles.
      
      The Contract will last for 2 years commencing 1st April 2022 with the provision to extend for up to an additional 1 year subject to funding and satisfactory performance.

This is a PIN notice for a Department for Business, Energy and industrial Strategy (BEIS) requirement**

This OPSS Research Collaboration Network is being commissioned to support the delivery of the Office for Product Safety & Standards (OPSS) Strategic Research Programme (SRP). OPSS was established by BEIS in January 2018 in order to enhance protections for consumers and drive forward increased productivity,
growth and business confidence.

The OPSS SRP provides high quality, strategic, science-based research to strengthen the evidence base for OPSS policy development, delivery and enforcement activities.
As an evidence-led organisation, OPSS places great importance on research which gathers insights on a number of evidence bases and challenges the product safety system faces. We intend that by setting up a Research Collaboration Network OPSS will bring together suppliers and create a community of researchers
dedicated to the OPSS objectives of keeping people safe and driving forward increased productivity, growth and business confidence. We propose that a joined-up approach for research commissioning will attract more suppliers and will create lists of subject matter experts we can call upon for peer review and technical
advice.

The aim of the OPSS Research Framework is to identify and utilise contractors with skill and expertise in the following areas to support the aims of our Strategic Research Programme (SRP):
- Lot 1: Risk (communications, management, measurement, prioritisation and tolerance);
- Lot 2: Chemicals and Materials (Identification, measurement, characterisation techniques and exposure studies and toxicological limits);
- Lot 3: Economic (Impact analysis, market analysis and consumer/business behaviours and attitudes);
- Lot 4: Technology hardware and software. (Literature reviews, SWOT analysis and research testing, focusing on batteries, mechanical and software engineering challenges).

The purpose of the Research Collaboration Network is to make it easier and faster for both contractors and OPSS to apply for and commission research, with contractors only required to make one large bid at the beginning of the framework start which will onboard them into a 'lot' relevant to their expertise. Research
requests from OPSS will be ad hoc and throughout the year but will relate to these four lots. The research requests will then be distributed to suppliers through much shorter 'mini competitions' which require less paperwork (usual turn-around time is approx. one week).",,"SW1H 0ET","Any region","73200000 79300000 ",,professionalservices@uksbs.co.uk,"Polaris House, North Star Avenue",,Swindon,"SN2 1FF",England,,,"Annex A - Framework Background.odt ",,"
We hope this Research Collaboration Network will also attract smaller research businesses and academic institutions, who may struggle with the demands of bidding of individual research from contracts finder or other government procurement routes. It is worth nothing that this will not subsume other methods of procurement and in some cases other frameworks could be used for some research when appropriate. We are particularly interested in suppliers who have experience in applying their research methods to nonmedical and non-food consumer products.

It is based on three underlying funds: Future World UK Equity Index, Future World Developed Equities Index and Global Emerging Markets (L class). The total Fund is split 55%, 35%, 10% among these three vehicles.

Total value of the Fund as at 31 March 2022, value circa £95.7m covering circa 4,820,051 units. The Lord Chancellor also manages a range of lower value or shorter term client deposits out with the CIF via deposit accounts currently paying 1.25% - see additional information for further details.

The Authority wishes to revisit the market in order to establish whether there may be other suitable investment products for a new arrangement covering both the current CIF funds and also some circa £100m - £200m of the other funds.

The aims of any future product within the CIF would be to provide relatively secure investment returns (medium to low risk) and capital growth for those with less to invest and/or a shorter term horizon. This might require more than one product to cover the differing needs in terms of shorter term and longer term clients, or providing for clients who may have a need for income as well as capital growth. Protection against capital loss might be achieved via risk mitigation or diversification measures. The risk profile means that passive/index-based approaches to asset classes are expected to be used.

The Authority requires that companies managing CIF funds are registered in the UK.

The estimated value of £350m is a forecast of future needs based on the amount of funds currently being managed inside and outside the existing CIF but which may become subject to a future CIF if suitable products are available.

Rapid diagnosis is one way to improve outcomes and experience for patients who present with a potential cancer diagnosis however, a shortage of consultant radiologists means there are delays in the provision of timely and accurate imaging reports. Radiographer reporting is one method to increase diagnostic capacity in a safe, effective, and efficient way. As part of the Phase 1 Cancer Workforce Plan, Health Education England (HEE) committed to train 300 reporting radiographers over two years.

Training capacity, variability in local workforce and possible impact on clinical services were identified as potential barriers to successful delivery of the radiographer reporting programme, especially for departments without a critical mass of experienced reporting radiographers. The education of reporting radiographers requires successful completion of a master's level qualification at a higher educational institute accredited by the College of Radiographers, underpinned by a significant component of workplace learning. 

Whilst there has been some regional data collection undertaken concerning the success of this funding offer, there has not yet been any formal evaluation at national level. It is anticipated that post pandemic, there will be renewed interest in the training of reporting radiographers and therefore to maximise the effectiveness of the future funding offers, it is proposed that a nationally led evaluation is undertaken to support the continuation of this vital programme or work. 

The aim is to undertake an evaluative project that identifies specific metrics concerning the completion and resultant service delivery impacts of the reporting radiographer funding since 2020.  To identify and outline barriers and challenges that affected the nationally led offer and make recommendations to support the efficiency and direction of future funding offers within the area of reporting radiography.  The outcomes from this project will support key deliverables of the NHSEI/HEE national imaging workforce plan 21/22 and actions needed for 2022/23

The contract will be awarded for 5 years with option to extend for a further 2 years. The service will form a cornerstone of the delivery of KCC's Adult Social Care approach, Making a Difference every Day (MADE), which seeks to drive consistent, high quality, person-centred and innovative support.

Technology Enabled Care will underpin our future care and support delivery and is critical to the Authority's vision for the social care and health landscape in Kent. The Technology Enabled Care Service will harness the potential benefits of digital technology to promote independent living and optimise a person's outcomes. 

Since March 2022, KCC has worked with a Partner to trial the principles of a Technology Enabled Care Service in a build and test project which operated in the East Kent area. The build and test has delivered excellent learning opportunities and understanding of the full potential associated to technology, and has informed the service specification for our county-wide Technology Enabled Care Service. In addition, we have undertaken market engagement throughout August and during September held 121 meetings with providers to work through key questions, all in which have informed the specification. The draft specification was shared with the market for comment during October. There has been a co-production group working with us to design the service, specification and will play a key role in the procurement and implementation of the service. 

KCC now wishes to appoint a Partner who will lead the implementation of the county-wide Technology Enabled Care Service, incorporating the delivery of a mobilisation from existing service provision, delivery of a wide range of digital technologies and apps, culture change management, utilising data and benefits realisation. The chosen Partner will work in a co-production approach with KCC and Kent residents to design and implement a service which aligns to our MADE approach. 

 The contract has been estimated at the value for adult social care however during the contract term it is expected that there will be opportunities with Health, Children's and District Councils to grow the service. We will consider consortia or where a lead Partner subcontracts and encourage Partners to consider working with SMEs. 

In the first instance, Partners can register an interest and to obtain additional information via the Proactis.  Submissions are due via the Kent Business Portal by 9 January 2023. Please allow adequate time for uploading documents and to dispatch the electronic responses well in advance of the closing tie to avoid last minute problems.

This partnership work involves all key partners and stakeholders including the PCN, the ICB, the hospital trust, community services and the local community. 

An essential requirement of this contract is the need for the provider to deliver services from the Village and to maintain a strong physical presence within the community. In the short term, there is the opportunity to utilise the existing practice premises (subject to negotiation with the landlord) and in the longer term there is the exciting potential of the integrated health hub that is in development by the partnership described above.  

Highley (WV16 6) is a rurally isolated large village in South Shropshire, 7.5 miles to the south of Bridgnorth with a population of 3,735 people.

To find out more about us please visit https://www.hsib.org.uk 

We wish to commission the development of a framework(s) to optimise the proposed Health Service Safety Investigation Body's (HSSIB) operating model, to enable the organisation to maximise its impact in helping the NHS and wider industry to learn from independent investigations and published safety recommendations. 

It is important that the development of the framework(s) delivers a blueprint for HSSIB to be more effective, efficient, proactive and responsive as an organisation. We must demonstrate that our organisation is providing value for money and effective safety recommendations to mitigate repeat harm for patients treated and cared for by the NHS in England.

The areas we require support in are as follows:

•	Develop a risk identification framework to enable HSSIB to identify patient safety topics, or themes, across multiple care settings to prioritise the focus of our independent investigations
•	Develop an evaluation framework to measure and demonstrate our impact to improve the safety of care across health services

Given the scope of, and the pace required for the programme, we welcome proposals from those Suppliers who have both a proven immediate capability and capacity of successfully delivering similar projects within the public sector.

CUSTOMER: 				DVLA


DATE RESPONSE REQUIRED:		12:00 noon on 16/01/2023

Dear Supplier,

DVLA is conducting a Request for Information (RFI) in regards to a potential procurement for Personalised Registration Auction Services. A similar service is currently provided to DVLA under a contract that expires in March 2024. DVLA plans to advertise a new procurement in early March 2023 to replace the existing service, but with a different scope being considered:  instead of a service to auction Personalised Registrations via both venue-based (physical) auctions and online auctions, a replacement service is being considered that is potentially entirely online, without any physical auctions.  

This RFI therefore seeks information from the potential supply market, to inform DVLA's commercial strategy for this potential procurement.

MHTRs form part of the wider Community Sentence Treatment Requirements (CSTRs) Programme which is a partnership between the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), NHS England (NHSE), Public Health England (PHE) and His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS).  

The CSTR Programme aims to develop pathways to enable and facilitate the increased use of all three treatment requirements:
-	Mental Health Treatment Requirements (MHTRs)
-	Drug Rehabilitation Requirements (DRRs)
-	Alcohol Treatment Requirements (ATRs)

ATRs and DRRs in Devon and Torbay are outside the scope of this procurement, beyond the co-ordination of CSTRs for combined orders. However, there is an expectation that MHTR and ATR & DRR providers will work closely together in the best interests of the service user, especially where it can be identified that a combined order is the best outcome.

MHTR in the context of the CSTR programme is intended for the sentencing of individuals convicted of an offence(s) which has crossed the community order sentencing threshold and may be used as an alternative to short custodial sentences for individuals who may have range of mental health, personality disorder and psychological issues/vulnerabilities, which do not require forensic or secondary care treatment.

The aims of the service are to:
•	Increase the proportion of offenders with mental health issues for whom an effective mental health treatment plan is in place.
•	Reduce re-offending by addressing the underlying causes of offending behaviour. 
•	Prevent custodial sentences (especially short ones), by offering robust community treatment options.
•	Provide tailored mental health support to the most vulnerable offenders. Individuals supported by pilot sites included those who suffered from post-traumatic stress, trauma, bipolar, personality and phobia disorders, psychosis and ASD. 

Contracts will be for a term of 2 years and 1 month.
The financial envelope relates to delivering an indicative volume of 150 MHTRs.

The Commissioner has a maximum budget available of up to £155,000 per annum and a total budget of up to £322,917 over the life of the contract. 

In addition to the funding for service delivery, up to £27,000 of mobilisation funding is available to support the process. 

Services are planned to commence on 01 March 2023.

 Hertfordshire and West Essex Integrated Care Board (HWE ICB) has a strategic vision for primary medical care services  to secure contracts that will ensure robust and sustainable long-term delivery and access to services.  The HWE ICB has a strong desire that the current premises are maintained within primary care ensuring adequate access, capacity, and resilience for general practice services. 

The HWE ICB currently has in place an APMS contract for Spring House Medical Centre in Welwyn Garden city which is coming to an end on 30th September 2023 .  The HWE ICB believes that the most appropriate way to achieve the strategic vision aim is to advertise this practice to an existing provider of primary medical care services, thus retaining the current premises as a branch with managed list dispersal to the successful bidder, under GMS terms.

The ICB believes that in general, the short-term nature of APMS Contracts do not provide longevity to enable strategic planning for the local area in the same way that GMS Contracts do. The HWE ICB want to ensure that we make effective use of resources and ensure financial sustainability for smaller practices such as Spring House Medical Centre, who have a current actual list size of 9314 (weighted list size: 7609).  

This approach will provide sustainability and continuity of services for both patients and the primary care workforce.

The Provider will be expected to work collaboratively with the Primary Care Network (PCN) to ensure access to all PCN additional workforce and services, along with the local GP Federation in the delivery of the Enhanced Access service; thus, creating a strong, safe and sustainable health and care system that is fit for the future.

The Provider is expected to deliver core general medical services and all locally commissioned services; in collaboration with other system providers.

To that end, HWE would like to engage providers through an Request for Information (RFI) process to receive feedback and understand potential interest from suitably qualified primary care providers for the provision of General Medical Services at Spring House Medical Centre.  

 This is not a formal procurement exercise but a request for information, the intention of which is to:

1.	Communicate the opportunity including an indicative future procurement timeline 
2.	Seek feedback from interested providers that may equitably inform the process
3.	Invite interested providers to a providers to complete a questionnaire

BFC is seeking interest in a proposal to transfer surplus council-owned land at 74-76 Binfield Road (RG42 2AR) to a Registered Provider (RP). It is proposed that offers over £100k will be invited for the freehold to enable a new development of 4 bed family homes for rent and meet a critical shortage of these homes in the area.

Site description
The total site area of the combined sites edged red on the site plan (74 and 76 Binfield Road) is approximately 1850 sq m. Planning permission was granted for the demolition of the existing buildings on 14 September 2022 (a copy is available on the planning portal under reference 22/00090/DEM) and the buildings are in the process of being demolished to slab level. This work will be completed before the site is transferred. 

Relevant planning history and policy
The previous use of 76 Binfield Road as an office would have fallen within B1(a) of the Use Classes Order (this would now fall within the much broader class E). There is no evidence of planning consent for this use being granted, but this use had existed for in excess of 10 years prior to the demolition of the buildings.

The previous use of 74 Binfield Road was as part of the adjoining adult services site and was used as short and medium stay residential facilities for adults with learning disabilities, which falls within use class C2 (residential institution). 

The proposed residential use would be within use class C3 and whilst there have been no discussions with the planning service, given the site comprises previously developed land within the defined settlement boundary, it is believed that the principle of redevelopment of the entire site for this use would be acceptable. 

The site is located within a predominantly residential area, with a petrol station to the North-West and adjacent to the existing access point. The site is located within 5km of the Thames Basin Heaths SPA and within 2km of an SSSI.

Other Terms
Subject to satisfactory interest from RPs the Council will be seeking offers in excess of £100k for the freehold, and on the basis of the following;
a)	The site is to be developed for affordable four bed family homes for rent. Higher priority will be given to bidders who are able to offer properties for rent at social rent, rather than affordable rent.
b)	Nomination rights to be granted to BFC in perpetuity
c)	The contract will be subject to the purchaser achieving a planning consent for their chosen scheme within a reasonable timeframe (to be agreed with the successful provider prior to contracts being exchanged).
d)	The homes must be delivered and made available for occupation within 2 years of completion of the sale (which will occur after the grant of planning consent).

For the avoidance of doubt, no offer below £100k will be considered

As at today's date the relevant contributions are as follows, but will need to be verified at the point of the application

•	A development of 100% affordable housing on the site will attract CIL social housing relief.   
•	SANG contributions payable would be a £ £3088 per unit for affordable dwellings 
•	SAMMS contributions would total £1,021 per unit for 4 bed units
•	There may be other s106 costs to be determined at the application state, which will depend on the detail of the scheme. For example SUDs monitoring fee, Traffic Regulation Order or Biodiversity Net Gain.
Access and parking
The site adjoins the publicly adopted highway to the south side on Binfield Road. Access into the site was historically via the adult services site to the rear, but has more recently been through a single point onto Binfield Road. Whilst this access point has not been regularised as part of previous planning applications for parking at the site, this has been the only access for in excess of ten years. Access to the site will need to be improved to make it suitable for the proposed redevelopment as the current access is not wide enough for easy two-way movements. The site is opposite a junction and adjoins a petrol station therefore careful consideration will be needed as to how to gain access to the newly developed properties. It is thought that a large number of new access points onto Binfield Road would most likely not be acceptable. 

Biodiversity
There are various trees on the site, which will need to be considered as part of any application. No tree survey is available and the purchaser will need to make their own investigations in relation to this. 

The previous buildings hosted a bat roost which has been relocated to a tree within the site. As part of the consent to demolish the previous buildings, a licence for development works affecting bats was obtained from Natural England. A copy can be supplied on request and the purchaser will need to continue to comply with the terms of this licence.

Utilities
Utilities are in the process of being disconnected as part of the demolition programme. The services will be disconnected prior to the sale and information on any known locations will be passed to the purchaser for information. The purchaser will however need to make their own enquiries to satisfy themselves as to the location of services and the capacity of services for the new development.

Natural England has a statutory duty to review these maps.  During the original 2004/05 mapping exercise the ability of the Countryside Agency to map downland was substantially impeded because the legislation did not allow for it to be mapped as a topographical feature.
 
There's a lack of any authoritative definitions of downland, and no existing datasets recording it. In order for the review to address this issue, we want to commission some research to define the downland landform. This definition will be used to inform the development of a Mapping Review Statutory Methodology. 
 
We want this study to look afresh at the whole downland issue by independently and objectively evaluating the relevant evidence both on the ground and in terms of historical or contemporary studies, publications, maps, datasets. We want the study to explore whether it is practicable and workable for the whole downland landform in each case to be defined and identified on maps, rather than any individual land parcels occurring within each identified down being considered individually and separately from each other, as happened under the original mapping process.

HSE/T4326,Contract,"Health & Safety Executive",Open,2022-12-08T12:14:44Z,"REQUIREMENTS FOR REVIEWING HOW TO REFINE THE RISK ASSESSMENT FOR AQUATIC ORGANISMS","Currently when assessing the risk to aquatic organisms from pesticides, HSE CRD follows EFSA 2013 (Guidance on tiered risk assessment for plant protection products for aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters). 

Risk mitigation
Where the outcome of the first tier aquatic risk assessment indicates concern, there is a need for risk mitigation or refinement. Mitigation may reduce the usefulness of the product (e.g. buffer zones), while refinement methods can be difficult to carry out due to their bespoke nature. HSE CRD is requesting a review of appropriate refinements for the aquatic risk assessment, including: consideration of pros and cons; issues that require consideration when using a particular refinement and restrictions to the circumstances in which a particular refinement may be used. This review will aid the applicant, and hence the regulator, in determining whether the risk to aquatic life is acceptable. Additionally HSE CRD is requesting a review of the approach used to determine the risk to sediment dwelling invertebrates, to determine whether it is fit for purpose. Currently this is carried out by comparing the NOEC or EC10 value (from either a water or spiked sediment effect study) with a PEC value (in terms of mg a.s./L or mg a.s./kg sediment).",,,"United Kingdom","03300000 ",,tenders@hse.gov.uk,"Redgrave Court, Merton Road",,BOOTLE,L207HS,England,02030284392,,,,"All tender documents are available via the HSE In-Tend supplier e-procurement portal.

The project end state is seeking to establish the viability of, and to provide, a deployable integrated launch module for loitering munitions through  a successful maritime, land and littoral concept demonstration. 

Industry advice is sought on the cost and timeframes (through VROM submissions) of key phases of activity to develop and demonstrate an initial concept system culminating in a number of live fire events.

This RFI invites industry to assist in establishing VROM cost and time estimates for the project in the following areas:
1.	Design, build, prepare and physical integration of systems into an ISO container POD;
2.	Procurement of medium sized loitering munitions to integrate into the ISO container POD;
3.	and, subsequent demonstrations to include deployment of ISO container POD, targets and range costs.
4.	This work is to be a concept demonstration only, in order to provide evidence for, and inform procurement decisions..
5.	Type of LM should support a cost-effective approach to a concept demonstration.
6.	Costs should include equipment, design, build, integration, safety, targetry and range costs.
7.	UK trials are preferential but overseas trials would be warranted in support of a cost-effective programme.
8.	Safe storage and maintenance of equipment delivered to support the trial should be considered.
9.	Include functionality to enable remote firing.
10.	Consider costs for both land and ship-based trials.
11.	Assume contractor operated - i.e. no military operators but consider what a training package would look like.
12.	If applicable, highlight any support required from any stakeholder OEMs, GFX, delivery partner, safety, integration and range personnel as required.
This RFI is to invite industry to assist FCG in shaping and costing this project which is potentially intended to be issued via DSP in Q2 2023.

Financial Services are a key sector for UK exports and a Relative Comparative Advantage for the UK.
According to the OECD Services Trade Restrictiveness Index of 50 countries, Thailand has the 3rd most restrictive market in Commercial Banking (0.423) and 1st in Insurance (0.557). 
In this regard, we would like to understand in further detail the precise nature of the restrictions, the rationale/drivers for Thailand's restrictiveness in these sectors and how the UK's government can help to reduce this restrictiveness - with the aim of increasing the UK's exports for service industry into Thailand.

The report/study should identify the tangible and realistic areas (including a set of short/long term recommendations) for the UK government to work on to improve/reduce the restrictiveness in financial and insurance sectors provided on the evidence-based information, including desktop research and interviews with businesses, experts, academics, and regulators.

The scope of the procurement will include design consultation for the facility including layout, groundwork specification, supply and installation and commissioning of all aspects of the facility.  This does not necessarily need to be one sub-contractor.
The facilities will initially consist of the following buildings/compounds with detail of the scope below:
- Cryogenic liquid gas storage compound with an expected area of 200sqm, this compound must access for lorry delivery, as well as safety and security fencing.
- Outdoor System on Test area with visibility of the sky will need to be a minimum of 100sqm and require services and with Radio Frequency (RF) invisible fencing.
- Workshop and Test Shelter/Garage this facility is expected to be 15m x 10m x 5m; the supporting foundations need to be able to support allow for vehicles/equipment on test of at least 60 tonnes.  The facility needs to be of modular and temporary design as the facility needs to be reconfigurable. The facility will have vehicles and large engines running on test with access doors closed alongside staff.  Therefore, large scale extraction, air conditioning, localised exhaust extraction and all necessary safety systems that can be monitored and controlled locally and remotely will be required.
- Chemical development lab will need to be able to accommodate a reception area 4-6 workstations, shower, and toilet facilities.

Data could be gathered through a quick pulse survey or as part of a comprehensive listening strategy with a view to generating actionable insights and identifying opportunities for impact.

Newcastle University has in the region of 28,000 students and 6,000 staff. The University requires a licence for approximately 6,500 stakeholders who may use the survey platform as end users. To date various licence agreements have been in place across the University for a range of survey platform providers for use across research, academic and cross-cutting requirements. The lack of consistency in terms of features and capability of these platforms has led to challenges when conducting data gathering exercises across target audiences. Therefore, the University is clear that the need to administer well-designed surveys exceeds the scale and capability of existing provision. 

The University's ambition is to provide a positive survey experience for all colleagues and students, enabled by a platform which includes powerful analytics, reporting tools and technical support when needed.

The scope of this tender is for the supply and support of a survey platform to be used by all members of the University, including those located in our Branch Campuses in Malaysia and Singapore.

Please note that tenders are only invited from bidders who have an existing off the

CF-0016100D8d000003VQwdEAG,Contract,Defra,Open,2022-11-30T09:00:43Z,"Offshore Wind Environmental Standards","The Authority's priorities are to secure a healthy natural environment; a sustainable, low-carbon economy; a thriving farming sector and a sustainable, healthy, and secure food supply.

OWES will take the form of a set of standardised measures that can be applied to the design, construction, operation, monitoring and decommissioning of an offshore wind farm which seek to minimise harmful impacts on the marine environment and/or deliver environmental benefits. Their primary aim is to create a clear, consistent approach to avoiding and mitigating the negative environmental impacts of offshore wind projects and, where possible, avoid the need for compensation. 
OWES will not remove the need for bespoke mitigation measures or the need to follow the mitigation hierarchy. Rather they will be a suite of pre-approved, standardised mitigation options which easily demonstrate to the examining authority a developer's consideration of the harmful environmental impacts of their proposed project. This should reduce the scope of a project's Rochdale Envelope, as a project's potential impacts will be smaller from the outset and smoothen the overall consenting process. For example, one OWES which could be used is a pre-agreed decibel limit for developers when pile-driving. This would provide a developer with a clear option for noise to minimise the project's impact on marine mammals.

While OWES will initially focus on protecting the marine environment - by ensuring developers avoid and/or mitigate their environmental damage - they have the potential to enhance the biodiversity of their surroundings (both inside and outside MPAs).  For example, OWES could standardise the incorporation of seabird monitoring technology into a turbine's design. This would improve overall understanding of the impacts of offshore wind development and help evidence further mitigation techniques. Projects could be fitted with oyster reefs to encourage biodiversity and limit the negative effects wind turbine installation has on the surrounding environment. Through The Rich North Sea programme1, sites across Germany, Demark and the Netherlands are starting to trial this approach.  

OWES will be introduced for offshore wind only.

We are seeking a project proposal to co-design a suite of suitable Offshore Wind Environmental Standards. 

To deliver a set of co-designed OWES with Defra Group, industry representatives and other identified stakeholders by July 2023.

The Shared Lives scheme will be expected: 
	To recruit a range of appropriate short and long term Shared Lives carers
	To offer high quality shared lives placements to service users
	To expand the long term shared lives service to meet the needs of service users and the development priorities of the service purchaser 
	To develop and expand the existing short break service to meet the needs of service users.
	To offer support for service users referred to the scheme in Plymouth
	To help develop service users independent living skills
	Support service users to be empowered to make informed choices and decisions about their care and treatment and to take greater control over their lives
	To help develop service users to become more independent and move on to a more independent environment if appropriate 

Within Plymouth there is currently 12 long-term Shared Lives clients, currently no short break placements; there are a range of client groups such as adults with a learning disability, physical disability or mental health need.
